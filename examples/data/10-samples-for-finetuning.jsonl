The priority of a task can be categorized as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW, allowing for the allocation of importance among tasks. Due dates are specified in the format \"year-month-day,\" providing a clear timeline for task completion. The status of a task is tracked through three states: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, or DONE, providing visibility into the progress of each task.
